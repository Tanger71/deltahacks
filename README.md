  TeachAI is a React application that uses the OpenAI API in order to generate a step-by-step
plan on how to teach others any given concept or skill. This web application was designed to be
accessible for any user, simply requiring a text prompt to be entered before a response is returned.
Once a response is returned, users can clarify certain steps by clicking on them to fetch more
detailed instructions to ensure user understanding of the information. Use TeachAI and start developing
